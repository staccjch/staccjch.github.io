I am a **data science student** with a strong interest in applying computational methods to address pressing social issues, including **humanitarian crises**, **migration**, and the role of **digital technologies** in divided societies. My recent work includes developing *interactive dashboards* to visualize humanitarian incident data, analyzing *cultural representation gaps* in major museum collections, and using *natural language processing* to study narratives about Latin American migration.

I earned my undergraduate degree in **Econometrics** at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/), where I built a solid foundation in *quantitative social studies research*, *statistics*, and *programming*. Now pursuing graduate studies in data science at [Georgetown University](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/), I continue to focus on projects that combine *rigorous analysis*, *storytelling*, and *visualization* to highlight underrepresented perspectives and inform public policy.

Beyond academics, I enjoy practicing **Pilates** and **barre** as a way to stay grounded and energized. I also share life with a *mischievous and affectionate cat*, who reminds me to balance work with play.
